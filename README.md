In this guide, you will learn how to install XAMPP stack and start with the PHP
development on the Windows platform.

XAMPP is an *all-in-one* stack that includes PHP, Apache HTTP server, and MariaDB
database. It stands for Cross-Platform (**X**), **A**pache, **M**ariaDB, **P**HP,
and **P**erl. The main advantage is a simple and fast installation of the popular
software for PHP development.

Usually, you won't see it in the production online environments directly because
its main purpose is the PHP development and using it locally on your workstation.

In case of issues, see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section at the
bottom of this guide.

## Install XAMPP

Download and install XAMPP from the official [website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

### Download XAMPP

Head over to the [download section](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
and choose the Windows installer `.exe` for the **PHP 7.2** version. Currently,
only 32-bit versions are available. This won't be an issue at this step even if
you have a 64-bit operating system.

---

### Run the installer

After the download completes, run the installer:

![XAMPP installer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpearth/assets/master/images/docs/install/win/xampp/installer.png "XAMPP installer")

---

### Confirm app changes

The installer will ask you to confirm changes on your workstation:

![XAMPP allow changes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpearth/assets/master/images/docs/install/win/xampp/allow-changes.png "XAMPP allow changes")

Click **Yes**.

---

### UAC warning

The following warning is notifying you about the UAC (User Account Control):

```text
Important! Because an activated User Account Control (UAC) on your system
some functions of XAMPP are possibly restricted. With UAC please avoid to
install XAMPP to C:\Program Files (x86) (missing write permissions). Or
deactivate UAC with msconfig after this setup.
```

![XAMPP UAC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpearth/assets/master/images/docs/install/win/xampp/uac.png "XAMPP UAC")

This means that in case your current Windows system has UAC enabled, you won't
be able to install XAMPP to the `C:\Program Files (x86)` location. You will be
able to install XAMPP elsewhere. For example, in `C:\xampp` folder, which is what
you want actually and this guide suggests further on.

To learn how to disable UAC, follow the procedure in the
[troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section at the bottom of this guide.

For security purposes avoid disabling the UAC as suggested in the warning and
click **OK**.

---

### Installation wizard

The *Installer's Welcome wizard* screen appears:

![XAMPP Welcome](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpearth/assets/master/images/docs/install/win/xampp/welcome.png "XAMPP Welcome")

Click **Next**.

---

### XAMPP components

The *Components* screen appears. Here you can choose only particular components
that you might need.

![XAMPP Components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpearth/assets/master/images/docs/install/win/xampp/components.png "XAMPP Components")

A quick components description:

* **Apache**

  This is the main web server that provides something visible at the URL
  `http://localhost`.

* **MySQL**

  This is the main database that will hold your data. This component is actually
  a MariaDB (a fork project of the MySQL), however for the simplicity of
  understanding things, here is called MySQL. Majority of the functionality and
  how to access it with PHP is the same as the MySQL.

* **Filezilla FTP Server**

  An additional component to help you upload files remotely. It won't be used on
  your local machine,

* **Mercury Mail Server**

  Server for sending emails. It won't be used in the local development
  environment.

* **Tomcat**

  This is Apache Tomcat web server for running Java code.

* **PHP**

  This is the main component that you want. PHP language software itself.
  Prebuilt, compiled, packaged, and ready for usage.

* **Perl**

  An additional programming language you might want to check out.

* **phpMyAdmin**

  Control panel with accessible via `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` for managing
  the database.

* **Webalizer**

  A separate web-based log analyzer for statistics and analysis. This won't be
  used on your local machine.

* **Fake Sendmail**

  This is a mailing simulation component that might be useful for sending emails
  on your development machine but not actually delivering them to the real
  address.

This guide will choose all components since they don't change the installation
size or other things much. Click **Next**.

---

### Installation folder

The installation location screen appears. In this guide, the `C:\xampp`. You can
choose to install it wherever you need, except the `C:\Program Files (x86)` as
warned above because of the UAC:

![XAMPP installation folder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpearth/assets/master/images/docs/install/win/xampp/folder.png "XAMPP installation folder")

Enter the folder location and click **Next**.

The XAMPP control panel has been launched:

![XAMPP control panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpearth/assets/master/images/docs/install/win/xampp/control-panel.png "XAMPP control panel")

Let's start Apache web server and the database. Click start buttons for Apache
and MySQL. You will get a firewall notification for the database service similar
to the one for Apache web server:

![XAMPP MySQL firewall](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpearth/assets/master/images/docs/install/win/xampp/firewall-db.png "XAMPP MySQL firewall")

Click **Allow** for your private network.

---

### Status

The control panel now indicates that Apache and MySQL services are up and running:

---

### Localhost

By visiting `http://localhost` in your browser, you should see an XAMPP welcome
screen, similar to this one:

![XAMPP localhost](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpearth/assets/master/images/docs/install/win/xampp/localhost.png "XAMPP localhost")

---

### Phpmyadmin

For managing the database, you can use the provided phpMyAdmin control panel,
which is available at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`:

![XAMPP phpMyAdmin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpearth/assets/master/images/docs/install/win/xampp/phpmyadmin.png "XAMPP phpMyAdmin")

---

## Post-installation steps

You are almost done. Few post-installation steps need to be done to have a better
development experience and additional tools at your disposal.

### PHP CLI

You will use command line a lot with modern PHP development and in order to
Windows recognize the PHP command, you need to add the PHP installation directory
to your `Path` environment variable.

When you type `php` in the command prompt, you will most likely get the
following error in the beginning:

```text
'php' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

![XAMPP php unrecognizd command](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpearth/assets/master/images/docs/install/win/xampp/unrecognized-command.png "XAMPP php unrecognized command")

Click *Windows Start* and type `environment variables` keywords in the search.
Click the result **Edit the system environment variables**. The **System Properties**
window opens:

![XAMPP system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpearth/assets/master/images/docs/install/win/xampp/system-properties.png "XAMPP system properties")

Click the **Environment variables**:

![XAMPP environment variables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpearth/assets/master/images/docs/install/win/xampp/environment-variables.png "XAMPP environment variables")

And add the PHP installation directory to the `Path` variable. In the case of
this guide, this is `C:\xampp\php`:

![XAMPP environment variable editing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpearth/assets/master/images/docs/install/win/xampp/edit-environment-variable.png "XAMPP environment variable editing")

Restart command line prompt, and the `php` command should now work:

![XAMPP PHP CMD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpearth/assets/master/images/docs/install/win/xampp/php-cmd.png "XAMPP PHP CMD")

## Troubleshooting

### Disabling UAC

This is actually not recommended for security purposes, however, in some cases,
you will want to disable the UAC.

* The first thing you need to do is checking if the current user has administrator
  privileges. Start command line prompt: `win-key + R` and type `cmd`:

  ![XAMPP run cmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpearth/assets/master/images/docs/install/win/xampp/run-cmd.png "XAMPP run cmd")

* Type `lusrmgr.msc`:

  ![XAMPP cmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpearth/assets/master/images/docs/install/win/xampp/cmd.png "XAMPP cmd")

* And check if your current user is in the `Administrators` group:

  ![XAMPP users](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpearth/assets/master/images/docs/install/win/xampp/users.png "XAMPP users")

* Once the account has administrator privileges, you can disable the UAC from the
  Control Panel. Open Control Panel and type *UAC* in the upper right search box.
  Click the *Change User Account Control settings*. Drag the slider to
  *Never notify*:

  ![XAMPP disable UAC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpearth/assets/master/images/docs/install/win/xampp/disable-uac.png "XAMPP disable UAC")

* This disables the UAC. Click **OK** and reboot the computer.

### Apache HTTP Server has stopped working

By the end of the XAMPP installation, you might get an error window notifying
you that Apache HTTP Server has stopped working and you have only option to
click the **Close program...** button.

Open XAMPP Control Panel and select `httpd.conf` Apache configuration file:

![XAMPP httpd.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpearth/assets/master/images/docs/install/win/xampp/control-panel-httpdconf.png "XAMPP httpd.conf")

And add the following code at the bottom of the file:

```Apacheconf
<IfModule mpm_winnt_module>
    ThreadStackSize 8388608
</IfModule>
```

The default Apache stack size on Windows is 1MB which sometimes causes crashes.

### Port 80 and Skype

A very common issue many users have is the blocked port 80 because the Skype is
using it and Apache cannot use it afterward.

To change the port in Skype:
* Open Skype
* `Tools` -> `Options`
* Select the `Advanced` option from the left column
* Select `Connection`
* Deselect the option that says, `Use port 80 and 443 as alternatives for incoming connections`
* Click Save
* Exit and then restart Skype

Now Skype and Apache can run at the same time on your workstation.

## What's Next?

Congrats! You've successfully installed XAMPP on Windows. The following steps
are recommended to install additional *must-have* tools for the best possible
development experience with PHP. Let's do that also.
